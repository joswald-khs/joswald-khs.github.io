# Mr. Oswald

This is my second year at Kents Hill and my twentieth year teaching. I serve as the Chair of the Technology and Engineering Department as well as being the Director of Technology Integration and Special Projects, and I live in Blethen House. 

My primary concern is lowering the barriers to entry into the field of Computer Science to allow in the variety of thoughts and perspectives we need to navigate the complexities that our tech-centric society has introduced to our daily lives.
